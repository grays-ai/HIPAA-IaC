### II. Data Classification and Management Policy

**I. Purpose**

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the classification, handling, and protection of data based on its sensitivity and importance to the organization.

**II. Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, volunteers, and any individuals who have access to the organization’s data and information systems.

**III. Definitions**

1. **Sensitive Data**: Data whose unauthorized disclosure may have a serious adverse effect on our organization, clients, or partners.

2. **Internal Use Data**: Data whose unauthorized disclosure may have a moderate adverse effect on our organization, clients, or partners.

3. **Public Use Data**: Data that can be freely disclosed to the public without causing harm or violating privacy laws.

**IV. Data Classification Policy**

Our organization categorizes data into three categories: Sensitive, Internal Use, and Public Use.

1. **Sensitive Data**
    * This includes electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) stored in our application environment on AWS, and any other data that can be personally identifiable or proprietary to our organization or partners. 
    * Handling of sensitive data should be minimized and limited only to those who need it to fulfill their job responsibilities. 
    * Sensitive data must be protected with strong security controls, including encryption at rest and in transit.

2. **Internal Use Data**
    * This includes internal communications, business operation data, employee data, and any other data that is not intended for public view, but whose unauthorized access or disclosure would cause less damage than Sensitive Data.
    * This data should be accessible only to employees and contractors of our organization and must be protected with appropriate security measures.

3. **Public Use Data**
    * This includes data intended for public distribution, such as marketing materials, publicly available reports, and general contact information.
    * This data requires less restrictive protection measures but should still be handled responsibly to ensure accuracy and integrity.

**V. User Interaction with Sensitive Data**

Our organization’s policies strictly govern user interactions with Sensitive Data:

1. Only authorized users can access sensitive data.
2. Sensitive data should not be transmitted or stored outside of the organization's secure systems without proper security controls.
3. Any suspicion of lost or compromised sensitive data must be reported to the Information Security team immediately.

**VI. Consequences of Lost or Compromised Data**

Failure to comply with these policies can result in severe consequences, including:

1. Disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
2. Legal penalties if the lost or compromised data leads to violations of privacy laws or breach of contractual obligations.

**VII. Enforcement**
