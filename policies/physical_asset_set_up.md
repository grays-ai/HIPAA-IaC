### Critical Settings

**Please ensure the following has been set up on your computer before you begin using it (for employees with PHI on their computers)**
1. ** Encrypt the disk in your hard drive.
2. ** Turn on host-based firewalls.
3. ** Turn off remote access. 
4. ** Install anti-virus, anti-malware, and anti-spyware software: ideally, set scans to be performed "on the fly," at startup, and on a schedule.
5. ** Set the screen saver to start after 15 minutes (this is required by standards such as PCI; note that CMS requires the screensaver to be triggered after 2 minutes). When the screen saver is triggered, ensure that a password is required to access the system.
6. ** Know how to control (turn on/turn off/enable/disable) Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDFs, postscript, Shockwave, and Flash, both on the computer and in the browser.
7. ** Install LastPass.
8. ** Behavior of your anti-virus, -malware, -spyware scanning should be available for audit. 
9. ** Your anti-virus software should be regularly updated.
10. ** Any company documents will be generated and stored in G Suite. 

**Do not do the following:**
1. ** Do not install any office software (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Apple Pages, Keynote).
2. ** Do not install backup software since almost everything will be in G Suite.
